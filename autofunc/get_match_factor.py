def match(thresh_results, test_records):

   """
         Compares the results learned from data mining with a verification case for which the actual results are known
         and outputs a "Match Factor" based on how well the automation matched the actual results as if they weren't known.

         Imports the results of the thresholding as well as the data from the verification case.

         The match factor is a ratio of correct to incorrect learning. Correct means a function and flow is learned for a
         component and that function and flow exist in the verification case for that component.

         Incorrect means one of two things. It could be overmatched, in which a function and flow is learned for a component
         that was not in the verification case. Unmatched means a function and flow exists in the verification case for a
         component that was not learned from the data mining.

         The match factor is then the correct matches divided by the sum of the overmatched and unmatched numbers.

         The outputs are the match factor as a number and dictionaries of each case: matched, overmatched, and unmatched.

         Parameters
         ----------
         thresh_results : dict
            The results of the "find_top_thresh" function
         test_records : dict
            The results of the "get_data" function for the verification test case

         Returns
         -------
         learned_dict
            Returns a dictionary of what was learned from the results of the data mining automation
         matched
            A dictionary of the functions and flows that were correctly matched for each component
         overmatched
            A dictionary of the functions and flows that were overmatched for each component
         unmatched
            A dictionary of the functions and flows that were unmatched for each component
         match_factor
            A float of the match factor
