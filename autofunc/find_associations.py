    """
        Uses apyori library to find association rules using the apriori algorithm within an itemset

        Parameters
        ----------
        store_data : Pandas data frame
            Data from a .csv file in Pandas data frame format
        records : List
            Same data as store_data but in a list
        support : float
            Threshold for support in apriori algorithm
        confidence : float
            Threshold for confidence in apriori algorithm
        lift : float
            Threshold for lift in apriori algorithm

        Returns
        -------
        conf_results
            Returns a dictionary of function and flow combinations sorted by confidence. The key is the
            component and the value is a list of type: [function-flow, confidence]
        results
            Returns a dictionary of function and flow combinations for each component with the values of
            support, confidence, and lift for each
