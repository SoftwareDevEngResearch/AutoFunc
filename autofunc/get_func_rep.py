    Find the functional representation of a set of components based on the results of data mining

    Parameters
    ----------
    thresh_results : dict
       The return dictionary from the "get_top_results" function
    input_comps : string
       The filename of a .csv file containing the components of a product
    conf_values : bool
        A boolean of whether or not to return the results with the confidence values, default is True

    Returns
    -------
    learned_dict
       Returns a dictionary of function and flow combinations sorted by confidence for each component in the input_case.
       The key is the component and the value is a list of function-flow combinations.
    unmatched
        Returns a list of components that were in the set of input components but not found in the data mining results.
